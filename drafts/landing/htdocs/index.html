									<p><strong>Learn about the insides of CERN and become a virtual scientist.</strong> The game takes you inside the Theoretical Physics group (TH) of the Physics department (PH), and gives you access to the same resources with the scientist. It then asks you the challenging question: <em>"What should we change in our theory to accurately represent nature?"</em>.</p>

				    <h4 class="media-heading">Standard Model, Super Symetry, Extra Dimentions ...</h4>
					<p>There is a dozen of theories floating around, all waiting to be validated or rejected. The most well-evolved, yet very complicated theory is what we call the <em>Standard Model</em> of particle physics. It describes the fundamental particles and their interactions, leaving outside the force of Gravity. A more complete, and more elegant theory is the <em>Super-Symmetry</em> (or SuSY), which relies on the fact that every particle should have one or more 'symmetric' particles. Unfortunately that theory is not yet validated. Lesser known theories, are the using <em>Extra Dimentions</em> to explain the fundamental particles and their forces, and a lot of others.</p>
					<p>As you see there is a lot of room for improvement in this field, and your contribution will be always welcome until we figure out how the universe works!</p>

				    <h4 class="media-heading">Event Generators</h4>
					<p>In order to validate a new theory, scientists are applying all it's rules and restrictions in a computer simulation. If their theory is correct, the computer simluation should produce excactly the same results as we observe in nature. In High-Energy Physics, what they are simluating is the collisions of particles (such as electrons or protons) with very high kinetic energy (99.9999991% the spee of light). After every collision, new particles are produced, out of pure energy and they run away from the collision point. This process of collision and production of new particles is called an <em>event</em>, and the software that produces such virtual collisions <em>event generator</em></p>

				    <h4 class="media-heading">Monte-Carlo Simulations</h4>
					<p>Due to their complexity and their chaotic nature, it's not possible to just get a papper and pencil and mathematically solve the equations that govern the universe! We are therefore left with only one solution: solve them numerically. This means that we will have to write down how we <em>think</em> the universe is working and then test if our theory is right for every numerical combination. Again, that's impossible, and therefore we are using <em>statistics</em>, trying to find the appropriate choice of numbers.</p>
					<p>A <em>Monte-Carlo simulation</em> uses random numbers in it's equations, which are carefully selected in order to represent the most relevant cases. Such simulations run thousands or even millions of times in order to produce a statistical sample that we can say for sure that the observed outcome is correct.</p>

					<p>We are using the event generator <a target="_blank" href="http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html">Pythia8</a>, which incorporates most of the current theories in High-Energy physics. From the game interface you are actually providing all the <em>fine-tuning</em> in the theory parameters and you are running Pythia8 to see what will come out.</p>
					<p>Each event, produced by the generator is just a bunch of particles, along with their physical information (such as momentum, charge, mass etc.). Since we are producing millions of them, we need somehow a mechanism to analyse them. For this reason we are using <a href="https://rivet.hepforge.org/" target="_blank">Rivet</a>, a program that reads the collision produced by the generator, runs a number of analyses and presents the results in histograms. These are the <em>results</em> you are looking in the game interface.</p>

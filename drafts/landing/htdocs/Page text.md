# Virtual Atom Smasher is...

## A virtual portal to CERN's scientific projects

Virtual Atom Smasher is a window to the insights of CERN. It brings you side by side with the theoritical Physicists in PH/TH department, gives you access to the same experimental software and data iviting you become yourself a virtual scientist. 

## An educational game

Virtual Atom Smasher is an intrudoction to quantum physics. While playing, just browse through the pop up books and learn particle physics, from the simplest terms to the more complexed variables of the latest experiments. 

## A contribution to the theoritical physicists work

By playing Virtual Atom Smasher you run real time simulations and the results are going to be used by theoritical physicists in the analysis of the parameter propabilities.???????



# More than a game: Physics and Programming behind the scenes

## An introduction to quantum physics

During the game you are introduced to various terms and variables of quantum physics that help you understand what particle physics is all about. Through the pop-up books that come up during the game's course, you come across not only the basic terms of particle physics, but also the latest  

## Monte Carlo simulation 

 In generators, Monte Carlo techniques are used to select all relevant variables according to the desired probability distributions, and thereby ensure (quasi-)randomness in the final events. A further advantage of the Monte Carlo method is that we can use the points generated to represent simulated events, since each point corresponds to a set of momenta for the particles involved. These simulated events can be used to histogram the distributions of observables of interest or passed to a detector simulation to study the response of the detector.

# Final State Radiation Game

## Game Purpose

The player perceives a general function of Final State Radiation by playing a virtual bridge building game. 

## Game's visual description

On both sides of the screen (left and right) are going to be vertically scattered hadrons. Near the top of the screen there will be a fragmented bridge with wholes. On the one end of the bridge a character will be waiting to cross it and go to the other end of the bridge, where there is a door that the character will enter.  

## Game Objective

The objective of the game is to reach as many Final State Showers as to patch the bridge on time, before the character passes. Upon a specific time, the character will start to walk on its own. Unless the player has patched all the wholes of the bridge the character will fall and the player will lose. If the player manages to build the bridge sucessfully before the time passes, the character will automatically start to cross the bridge. 
The Final State Shower will happen when the player cliks on two of the particles (one on each side) and then gives them enough or the correct force in order to collide and start the shower process (from initial state to final state shower). 

## Game Details

1. Depending on what two particles the player will choose (click on), the angle and the direction of the shower will vary. That is what will guide the Final State Shower particles to patch all the fragments of the bridge.
2. The Final State Shower products will dipend on the force the player will give to the collision. The smaller the collision, the less Final State Shower product will be produced and an insuficient width of bridge will be patched. The bigger the collision, the more Final State Shower product will be and a more suficient width of bridge will be patched. 
3. The visualization of the collision and the parton shower in this game is very simplified so that the player can concentrate only on the final state shower. 
4. In the game there will be an inverse time count down that will triger the character to start walking when it comes to zero. As the game gets more difficult, the minutes avaliable for the inverse count down will be fewer.
5. The player will have to chose correctly wich particles will colide. This is the puzzle part of the game. The correct particles after the collision will emmit to the correct angle the final state shower products. The player will have to combine the correct particles in order to do that. 
6. The number of the particles avaliable for collision will be 6 on the first level and grow as the levels pass.

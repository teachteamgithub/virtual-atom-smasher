# Color Charge Game

## Game Intention

This is a puzzle game, where the player will learn what color charge combinations leed to a formation of a stable hadron. 

## Game Optical Description

The player can see circles of different colors scattered in the screen. They represent the color charged quarks. Blue, Antiblue, Green, Antigreen, Red, Antired. 

## Game Objective

The player has to find the best possible way to connect the quarks so that baryons and mesons are formed. In the end of the game the player will have to connect all the quarks into hadrons ( baryons or mesons). This formation is based entirely on color charge. The player will be able to connect the correct quarks by clicking on them with the mouse. When that happens, conecting lines will appear to indicate that the quarks have now formed a hadron. These connecting lines must not cross one another. So the player has to find the correct way to connect all the quarks without crossing their connecting lines. 
The game can be divided into small rounds ( πίστες) from easier mode to more difficult. As the game evolves each round will have quarks put in the screen in ways that it will be more and more difficult for the player to connetc correctly all the quarks. 

## Game Details

Baryons are formed of three quarks. Their color charged can be  (in any sequence) either Red, Blue, Green, or Antired, Antiblue and Antigreen.  

Mesons are formed of a quark and an antiquark. That means that there is a color charged quark and its anticolor. So the pairs here can be blue - antiblue, green - antigreen, red - antired.

## Quark coloring

Red color charge is #FF0000
Blue color charge is #0000FF
Green color charge is #00FF00

Antired color charge is #00FFFF
Antiblue color charge is #FFFF00
Antigreen color charge is #FF00FF

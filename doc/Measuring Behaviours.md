# Measuring Behaviours in VAS

There are various locations where Virtual Atom Smasher interface tracks the user’s behavior, summarized in the following list:

  1. **Google Analytics** – Tracking low-level user behaviors, such as bad clicks, interface or game actions. This is particularly useful for checking the usability of the interface. The full list of tracked actions can be found on [[Measuring Behaviours.md]].
  2. **Registration Survey** – This survey is part of the registration interface.
  3. **Pre-evolution questionnaire** – A moderate-sized questionnaire shown 

There is a unique tracking ID allocated to each user.

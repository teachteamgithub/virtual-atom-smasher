##Parton Showers

A Parton Shower is the continuous emission of partons in a branchlike form. We use the term parton shower as a general term describing the various states of the shower functions.

## Final State Shower 

The final state shower is a branchlike form of parton emission before the hadronization process starts.

## Initial State Shower

The hard subprocess, by definition, involves large momentum transfers and therefore the partons involved in it are violently accelerated. Just as accelerated electric charges emit QED radiation (photons), the accelerated colored partons will emit QCD radiation in the form of gluons. Unlike the uncharged photons, the gluons themselves carry color charges and can therefore emit further radiation, leading to parton showers.

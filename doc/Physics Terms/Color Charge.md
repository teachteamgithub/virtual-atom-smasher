# About the color charge of guons and quarks

When we refer to quarks and gluons we refer to the strong force that applies in the interactions between them, as color force. 
Color Force is not to be confused with Strong Force that applies in bigger sale interactions. From a point of view Strong Force is the residue of Color Force. 

Here are some terms for the better understanding of the phenomenon and a guide of how color and anticolor is distributed:

## Quantum Chromo Dynamics

Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) is the current local gauge theory used to describe how quarks have strong interactions. 

## Color Charge 

There are two types of [[hadrons]]: baryons and mesons. Every [[baryon]] is made up of three quarks and every meson is made of a [[quark]] and an antiquark. For example the [[proton]] is composed of two up quarks and a down quark (uud). All quarks have the same quantum numbers for such properties as [spin], size, parity, etc. Therefore , according to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] which states that no two identical objects can occupy the same place, it is impossible for one particle to contain two of the same kind of quark. Yet the proton contains two up quarks. Because of this contradiction, it was proposed that quarks must have another property with six manifestations. This new property was labeled color (which  should not be confused with the common understanding of color). The six manifestations are termed red, blue, green, antired, antiblue and antigreen. The anti-colors belong appropriately, to the antiquarks. To obey the Exclusion Principle, all three quarks in a [[baryon]] are of different colors and a [[meson]] must contain a colored quark and a quark of the corresponding anticolor.

## Color Force 

Color Force is the strong interaction that is completely based on color charge.When two quarks are close to one another, they exchange [[gluons]] and create a very strong color force field that binds the [[quarks]] together. Because gluons are considered to carry both a color and an anticolor charge, quarks constantly change their color charges as they exchange gluons with other quarks.
A property of color force is that it does not drop off with distance. So during the exchange of gluons between quarks, and when two quarks stretch the color force that binds them together to a bigger space, the color force remains so strong, that a new pair of quark-antiquark is produced before the two quarks are separated. 
Another property of color force is that it appears to exert little force at short distances so that the quarks are like free particles within the confining boundary of the color force and only experience the strong confining force when they begin to get too far apart. 

## Color Confinement

Color-charged particles cannot be found individually. For this reason, the color-charged quarks are confined in groups ([[hadrons]]) with other quarks. These composites are color neutral (white). Because quarks, (according to the Standard Model's theory of strong interactions) combine only into baryons and mesons, consisting of three quarks and a pair of [[quark]] - antiquark respectively, we conclude that in order to exist in a stable state they must have in total a neutral color charge (zero color charge).

## Specifics about color and anticolor.

In order for a baryon or a meson to be in a stable state, the particles that it is consisted of must combine into white (neutral) color charge.
In baryons (particles that are made up from 3 quarks) the color charge of the quarks is red, blue and green, which combine into white (neutral) color charge. However in mesons (particles that are made from 2 quarks, a quark and an antiquark) in order to have white (neutral) color charge it contain a color and an anticolor. So for example a red and an antired so that the two color charges cancel each other out.

## What happens with gluons

Gluons are carrier particles of color force. They carry both a color and anticolor. Because gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks, they change the color charge of the quarks as they are emitted or absorbed. This constant changes happen instantaneously in a way that the total color charge (despite of the constant color charge changes) remains white (neutral). 

## Color charge combinations of gluons

There are 9 possible color charge combinations in gluons.

red   anti-red,   red   anti-blue,   red   anti-green,
blue  anti-red,   blue  anti-blue,   blue  anti-green,
green anti-red,   green anti-blue,   green anti-green.

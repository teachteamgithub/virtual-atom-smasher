# Hadronization ( or Fragmentation )

In this component, all the [partons] that carry a [colour charge] form strings with each other so that their combined colour is white. Hadronization is the physical process by wich quarks and gluons turn into hadrons. 



Given big amounts of energy, the [gluon] [strings] that bond the [quark] particles will elongate and snap, forming a quark-[antiquark] pair and in concequence the final particles [(hadrons)]. Each string can brake into a number of hadrons. Large strings give many hadrons. Short s trings give fewer hadrons.

Να σημειώσω ότι εκεί που λέω τα τελικά σωματίδια hadrons είναι ουσιαστικά mesons. Να δούμε πως θα τα γράψουμε αυτό.
Από τα μεσόνια προκύπτουν τα βαρυόνια; ( how many baryons for each meson )

## Hadron

In particle physics, a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force (in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). In contradiction to [leptons], hadrons interact with each other by [strong force] [bozons]. The name hadron came from the Greek word αδρός ( hadros ) which means strong. 

## Lepton 

Lepton is a [Fermion]. It means that it has a [spin] of 1/2. Leptons are an independent category of particles that do not participate in [strong force] interactions. They are not components in other particles and they are not consisted of other particles themselves. They divide into three catigories. The [electron], the [mion] and the lepton [tau]. 

## Electron

The electron is a fundamental subatomic particle. It has a [spin] of 1/2 and a negatice electric charge. Its mass is 1,836 x 10^3 smaller than the [proton].

## Mion

Mion is an unstable [fundamental particle] and it is heavier than the eletrons and the [netrinos]. They decay through weak force interactions into electrons. Mion has a short life spam and it is unstable in contradiction to [electron] that is stable and in a way lives for ever. 

## Tau

Tau is a particle similar to electron. It has [spin] of 1/2 and a negative electric charge. The interactions that lepton tau participates are very similar to the ones of the electron. However the tau lepton is a heavier version of the [electron].  

## Parton
 
The name Parton was intruduced in 1969 from [Richard Feynman] to analyse high-energy [hardon] collisions. Later it was recognised that Partons described the same objects more comonly known as [quarks] and [gluons].

##Fermion

All the [fundamental particles] are either fermions or [bozons]. Fermions have half-integer spin and therefore they are constrained by the [Pauli exclusion principle]. They include elecrons, protons, [neutrons] and consequently [quarks] and [leptons]. This means that a fermion can be an [elementary particle] or a [composite] one.

# Hadronization ( or Fragmentation )

In this component, all the [partons] that carry a [colour charge] form strings with each other so that their combined colour is white. Hadronization is the physical process by wich quarks and gluons turn into hadrons. 



Given big amounts of energy, the [gluon] [strings] that bond the [quark] particles will elongate and snap, forming a quark-[antiquark] pair and in concequence the final particles [(hadrons)]. Each string can brake into a number of hadrons. Large strings give many hadrons. Short s trings give fewer hadrons.

Να σημειώσω ότι εκεί που λέω τα τελικά σωματίδια hadrons είναι ουσιαστικά mesons. Να δούμε πως θα τα γράψουμε αυτό.
Από τα μεσόνια προκύπτουν τα βαρυόνια; ( how many baryons for each meson )

## Hadron

In particle physics, a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force (in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). In contradiction to [leptons], hadrons interact with each other by [strong force] [bozons]. The name hadron came from the Greek word αδρός ( hadros ) which means strong. 

## Lepton 

Lepton is a [Fermion]. It means that it has a [spin] of 1/2. Leptons are an independent category of particles that do not participate in [strong force] interactions. They are not components in other particles and they are not consisted of other particles themselves. They divide into three catigories. The [electron], the [mion] and the lepton [tau]. 

## Electron

The electron is a fundamental subatomic particle. It has a [spin] of 1/2 and a negatice [electric charge]. Its mass is 1,836 x 10^3 smaller than the [proton].

## Mion

Mion is an unstable [fundamental particle] and it is heavier than the eletrons and the [netrinos]. They decay through weak force interactions into electrons. Mion has a short life spam and it is unstable in contradiction to [electron] that is stable and in a way lives for ever. 

## Tau

Tau is a particle similar to electron. It has [spin] of 1/2 and a negative [electric charge]. The interactions that lepton tau participates are very similar to the ones of the electron. However the tau lepton is a heavier version of the [electron].  

## Parton
 
The name Parton was intruduced in 1969 from [Richard Feynman] to analyse high-energy [hardon] collisions. Later it was recognised that Partons described the same objects more comonly known as [quarks] and [gluons].

##Fermion

All the [fundamental particles] are either fermions or [bozons]. Fermions have half-integer spin and therefore they are constrained by the [Pauli exclusion principle]. They include elecrons, protons, [neutrons] and consequently [quarks] and [leptons]. This means that a fermion can be an [elementary particle] or a [composite] one. 

## Pauli Exclusion Principle

## Boson-Einstine Statistics

## Strong Force

Strong Force is the mechanism that keeps [color charged] particles bound together. It confines [quarks] together in order to form [hadrons] such as [protons] or [neutrons], ensuring stability in ordinary matter. Strong Force has [carrier particles] called [gluons]. 

## Bozon

Bozons are particles with integer [spin] and therefore are not constrained by the [Pauli exclusion principle]. They follow the [Bose-Einstine statistics].   

## Spin

## Proton

Proton is one of the subatomic particles. As a nucleon, it is one of the basic structural elements and along with neutron they constitute the main mass of an atom. A proton is classified in the category of hadrons. Specifically it is a baryon that is composed of tow up quarks and one down quark. 


## Neutron

Along with the protons they make 

## Fundamental Particle / Elementary Particle

## Composite Particle

## Neutrinos 

Neutrinos are [leptons] without an [elecrtical charge] and they have no mass. They almost never interact with the rest of matter. There are three known types of netrinos that include a charged [lepton] and its corresponding netrino. In other words every charged lepton e- μ- τ- is acompanied in weak reactions by its own netrino νe, νμ, ντ. Neutrinos are produced in a variety of interactions, especially in particle decays. In fact, it was through a careful study of radioactive decays that physicists hypothesied the neutrino's existence.

## Quark

Quarks are fundamental structural elements of matter. They are found inside the particles of the [nucleus], that is [protons] and [neutrons]. Protons and neutrons are composed of two types of quarks. Up quarks and down quarks. However nature designed for each type of quark two similar replicas that are heavier than the original, up and down quarks. The heavier replicas of an up quark are called charm and strange and the heavier replicas of a down quark are called strange and bottom.

## Gluon 

 Gluons where named after glue, because they "glue" [quarks] together. They can be considered to be fundamental exchange particles (carrier particles) that exercise the strong interaction between quarks (protons and neutrons in a nucleus). Gluons are [bozons] with integer spin 1 and zero [electric charge].

## Carrier Particles ( ατελές )

In particle physics carrier particles, or force carriers, are particles that give rise to forces between other particles. These particles are bubbles of energy ( [quanta] ) of particular kind of field. 

## Nucleus

## Quanta

## Jets

Jets are groups of particles that are produced from specific high energy collisions. Such collisions produce highly energetic quarks and gluons. As they move further from the collision point they emit in their turn more gluons, and the last emited gluons send out even more gluons and so on. This process leads to a cone like shape of particles that is called a jet. In the last phase of a jet, quarks and gluons combine into hadrons, like protons, pions and kaons.

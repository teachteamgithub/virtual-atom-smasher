# Hadronization ( or Fragmentation )

In this component, all the [partons] that carry a [colour charge] form strings with each other so that their combined colour is white. Hadronization is the physical process by wich quarks and gluons turn into hadrons. 



Given big amounts of energy, the [gluon] [strings] that bond the [quark] particles will elongate and snap, forming a quark-[antiquark] pair and in concequence the final particles [(hadrons)]. Each string can brake into a number of hadrons. Large strings give many hadrons. Short s trings give fewer hadrons.

If one of the quarks in a given hadron is pulled away from its neighbors, the color-force field "stretches" between that quark and its neighbors. In so doing, more and more energy is added to the color-force field as the quarks are pulled apart. At some point, it is energetically cheaper for the color-force field to "snap" into a new quark-antiquark pair. In so doing, energy is conserved because the energy of the color-force field is converted into the mass of the new quarks, and the color-force field can "relax" back to an unstretched state.

(Due to the fact that the strong force increases with distance, confinement of quarks exists. There are no free quarks; no quarks have the ability to break away from their hadron. However, within a very small area, quarks have the freedom to move anywhere. This property is called asymptotic freedom.

All hadrons are composed of groups of quarks. They are formed when a quark and an antiquark move away from each other and new quark-antiquark pairs are formed due to the increase in energy required to separate the original quark and antiquark. This concept can be thought of as a magnet with a north and south pole that is broken into pieces. The pieces each still have a north and south pole. So it is with quarks when the color force is broken. Color is still conserved and each particle is colorless.

Another product of color is residual strong interaction, which accounts for protons sticking together in the nucleus of an atom even though they all have the same electric charge. The quarks of one proton become glued to the quarks of another proton and the attraction between the quarks is strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the charged protons.

Color, then, is the property of quarks that allows two otherwise identical quarks to exist in the same particle simultaneously. Color also is the source of the strong, or color, force which binds quarks together. Quarks exchange gluons, which are also colored, in order to stick together and in so doing, change color themselves. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory explaining this strong force and it is very similar to the more familiar Quantum Electrodynamics. The major difference being that color replaces electric charge.)

Free quarks are never observed, i.e. a quark never exists on its own for a time longer
than ∼ 1/Λ: up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks all hadronize, i.e. become part
of a meson or baryon, on a timescale ∼ 1/Λ; the top quark instead decays before it has
time to hadronize.

## Hadron

In particle physics, a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force (in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). In contradiction to [leptons], hadrons interact with each other by [strong force] [bozons]. The name hadron came from the Greek word αδρός ( hadros ) which means strong. 

## Lepton 

Lepton is a [Fermion]. It means that it has a [spin] of 1/2. Leptons are an independent category of particles that do not participate in [strong force] interactions. They are not components in other particles and they are not consisted of other particles themselves. They divide into three catigories. The [electron], the [mion] and the lepton [tau]. 

## Electron

The electron is a fundamental subatomic particle. It has a [spin] of 1/2 and a negatice [electric charge]. Its mass is 1,836 x 10^3 smaller than the [proton].

## Mion

Mion is an unstable [fundamental particle] and it is heavier than the eletrons and the [netrinos]. They decay through weak force interactions into electrons. Mion has a short life spam and it is unstable in contradiction to [electron] that is stable and in a way lives for ever. 

## Tau

Tau is a particle similar to electron. It has [spin] of 1/2 and a negative [electric charge]. The interactions that lepton tau participates are very similar to the ones of the electron. However the tau lepton is a heavier version of the [electron].  

## Parton
 
The name Parton was intruduced in 1969 from [Richard Feynman] to analyse high-energy [hardon] collisions. Later it was recognised that Partons described the same objects more comonly known as [quarks] and [gluons].

##Fermion

All the [fundamental particles] are either fermions or [bozons]. Fermions have half-integer spin and therefore they are constrained by the [Pauli exclusion principle]. They include elecrons, protons, [neutrons] and consequently [quarks] and [leptons]. This means that a fermion can be an [elementary particle] or a [composite] one. 

## Baryon

## Meson

## Pauli Exclusion Principle

## Boson-Einstine Statistics

## Strong Force

Strong Force is the mechanism that keeps [nucleus] particles bound together. It confines [quarks] together in order to form [hadrons] such as [protons] or [neutrons], ensuring stability in ordinary matter. Strong Force has [carrier particles] called [gluons], which mediate the forces between quarks. We should note that quarks forming protons and neutrons are considered to be [color charged] particles and they are held together by the [color force]. So the strong force between the nucleus may be a residual color force. 

## Coupling Constant

A coupling constant is a parameter that measures the strength of the force exerted in an interraction. It is dimensionless and determines values for the four fundamental forces: Strong (As) , Electromagnetic (A), Weak (Aw), Gravity (Ag).

## As Strong Coupling Constant

## Lund String Model Parameters.

## Bozon

Bozons are particles with integer [spin] and therefore are not constrained by the [Pauli exclusion principle]. They follow the [Bose-Einstine statistics].   

## Spin

## Proton

Proton is one of the subatomic particles. As a [nucleon], it is one of the basic structural elements and along with neutron they constitute the main mass of an atom. A proton is classified in the category of [hadrons]. Specifically it is a [baryon] that is composed of tow up quarks and one down [quark]. 


## Neutron

Along with the [protons], neutrons make up the [nucleus], held together by the [strong force]. The neutron is a [baryon] and it is considered to be composed of two down quarks and one up [quark]. A free neutron will decay with a [half-life] of about 10,3 minutes. Its decay involves the [weak interaction] and is associated with a quark transformation in wich a down quark is converted to an up during that process. However when the neutron is combined with protons and form a nucleus, it is stable.

## Weak Interaction ( ateles )

Weak interaction is one of the four fundamental forces and it involves

## Half-life


## Fundamental Particle / Elementary Particle

## Composite Particle

## Neutrinos 

Neutrinos are [leptons] without an [elecrtical charge] and they have no mass. They almost never interact with the rest of matter. There are three known types of netrinos that include a charged [lepton] and its corresponding netrino. In other words every charged lepton e- μ- τ- is acompanied in weak reactions by its own netrino νe, νμ, ντ. Neutrinos are produced in a variety of interactions, especially in particle decays. In fact, it was through a careful study of radioactive decays that physicists hypothesied the neutrino's existence.

## Quark

Quarks are fundamental structural elements of matter. They are found inside the particles of the [nucleus], that is [protons] and [neutrons]. Protons and neutrons are composed of two types of quarks. Up quarks and down quarks. However nature designed for each type of quark two similar replicas that are heavier than the original, up and down quarks. The heavier replicas of an up quark are called charm and strange and the heavier replicas of a down quark are called strange and bottom.

## Gluon 

 Gluons where named after glue, because they "glue" [quarks] together. They can be considered to be fundamental exchange particles (carrier particles) that exercise the strong interaction between quarks (protons and neutrons in a nucleus). Gluons are [bozons] with integer spin 1 and zero [electric charge].

## Richard Feynman

## Electric Charge

## Quantum Chromo Dynamics (ateles)

Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) is the current local gauge theory used to describe how quarks have strong interactions. 

## Color Charge 

There are two types of [hadrons]: baryons and mesons. Every [baryon] is made up of three quarks and every meson is made of a [quark] and an antiquark. For example the proton is composed of two up quarks and a down quark (uud). All quarks have the same quantum numbers for such properties as [spin], size, parity, etc. Therefore , according to the [Pauli Exclusion Principle] wich states that no two identical objects can occupy the same place, it is impossible for tone paricle to contain two of the same kind of quark. Yet the [proton] contains two up quarks. Because of this contradiction, it was proposed that quarks must have another property with six manifestatios. This new property was labeled color ( whic should not be confused with the common understanding of color). The six manifestations are termed red, blue, green, antired, antiblue and antigreen. The anti-colors belong appropriately, to the antiquarks. To obey the Exclusion Principle, all three quars in a [baryon] are of different colors and a [meson] must contain a colored quark and a quark of the corresponding anticolor.

(This definition is from Lena Hansen from http://www.phy.duke.edu/~kolena/modern/hansen.html)

## Color Force 

Color Force is the strong interraction that is completely based on color. When two quarks are close to one another, they exchange [gluons] and create a very strong color force field that binds the [quarks] together. Because gluons are considered to carry both a color and an anticolor charge, quarks constantly change their color charges as they exchange gluons with other quarks.
A property of color force is that it does not drop off with distance. So during the exhange of gluons between quarks, and when two quarks strech the color force that binds them together to a bigger space, the color force remains so strong, that a new pair of quark-antiquark is produced before the two quarks are separated. 
Another property of color force is that it appears to exert little force at short distances so that the quarks are like free particles within the confining boundary of the color force and only experience the strong confining force when they begin to get too far apart. 

## Color Confinement

Color-charged particles cannot be found individually. For this reason, the color-charged quarks are confined in groups ([hadrons]) with other quarks. These composites are color neutral (white). Because quarks, ( according to the Standard Model's theory of strong interactions δεν ξέρω αν θα το βάλω αυτό στην παρένθεση) combine only into baryons and mesons, consisting of three quarks and a pair of [quark] - antiquark respectively, we conclude that in order to exist in a stable state they must have in total a neutral color charge.


## Carrier Particles ( ατελές )

In particle physics carrier particles, or force carriers, are particles that give rise to forces between other particles. These particles are bubbles of energy ( [quanta] ) of particular kind of field. 

## Nucleus

## Nucleon

The word nucleon is a general term of the particles that make up the atomic [nucleus]. Each atomic nucleus consists of one or more nucleons. There are two kinds of nucleons. The positively charged [proton] and the uncharged [neutron].

## Quanta

## Jets

Jets are groups of particles that are produced from specific high energy collisions. Such collisions produce highly energetic quarks and gluons. As they move further from the collision point they emit in their turn more gluons, and the last emited gluons send out even more gluons and so on. This process leads to a cone like shape of particles that is called a jet. In the last phase of a jet, quarks and gluons combine into hadrons, like protons, pions and kaons.

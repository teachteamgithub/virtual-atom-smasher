# Bugs

- Videos are not working on iPad
- Audio playback is not working on iPad
- Create a password reset interface
- Use ESC to hide pop-up windows
- The pre-evaluation iFrame did not provide a scrollbar on iPad
- Add wiki links on the Histograms
- Add a global indicator on the running interface that shows the current fit
- I want to take again the introduction course
- After you got the credits, the next part was not glowing yellow.
- When there is no simulation results, the 'View Histgorams' button raises an error.
- Some jobs go more than 110%, what's wrong there?
- Add the ability to re-take the introduction video.
- Add a quick 'View' button on the latest run.
- Write down what's the minimum browser versions supported, or alert people if they are using an outdated version. People had Safari 5.1 installed!
- Fix the bug where overlaying content appears on the tabbed books interface. This occurs when any tab other than the first is selected before bringing-up the tuning screen.
- When you create a new paper, get the defaults from the previous paper.
- Make it clear on the 'Paper' that you need to run a simulation **first** before you see some values in the results.
- Add 1Ïƒ bands to the ratio histograms.

# Observations

- It takes way too much time to finish a simulation. The student will click start, simulate, wait 10 minutes and then go home...
- "I started tuning starting from the left side of the parameter and moving towards the right side. I am not waiting for the simulation to complete, if I see things getting better, I just abort"
- "I always have to look on the histograms in order to check if their values are good or bad."
- Histograms have some quite complex terms. 
- Students will skip the introduction
- "Green means good, Black means bad": We are missing explanation on the tuning screen.
- Everyone was 100% bored after 30'
- I don't know what's the initial values, I don't know what these parameters are, 'Estimate' does not provide any useful information... I am completely lost.
- People are missing eplanations of the tunable parameters.
- Reaction: What are these parameters, and how they fit to the model. 
- I wouldn't know if the data are so important unless you have told us.
- It looks good, but I have absolutely no idea what's happening here.
- The fact that I a look in the head talking to me is not the best. I prefer to be able to re-read the content by myself.
- Why the kids choose this this this in the game.
- Can we have an an analogy for every parameter? 
- Kids are impatiently going to go directly through the game.

- Kids are getting easily border, so perhaps a change of color(?) or something(?). 
    - Show the progress with different color? From red to green perhaps? To let them know that they are getting close to something?

- I am not really patient with these games
    - "I have no clue what I am doing"
    - "I think it's boring to look at it"
    - Boing to watch all these videos
    - It should be more obvious for what to do.
    - I don't know what I am doing with the interface. I know that I should change that slider and click validate, but what's really happening?

# Cons

- It takes too much time to complete.
- Notifications were lost really fast
- Didn't worn on the iPad

# Pros

- The design
- The interface is well-designed, catchy
- The statistics and the details

# Suggestions

- While waiting, a mini-game might be interesting.
- Find an analogy of ANY sort for every parameter. When the user moves it's cursor over a particular parameter, show that analogy infographic in the tab.
- Have an interactive inforgraphic that respond to the changes that you do to the tunable parameters.
- Visuals for what everything means is great.
- It would be nice to se something.
- I would like a "cartoon person" explaining parts of the itnerface, with written text that I can refer to.
- For the procedural presentation, it would be good to know how long it's going to be.
- What I would like is a tutorial with a (cartoo character perhaps?) or with some pop-up screens, but not a real person. "My student's won't like that". Perhaps a smaller sequences.
- Much student-friendlier interface. "For me Gray thing is OK, but they may went for colors"
- If the results are bad, how can I know which parameter to improve?
- Write down which observables correlate to which parameter.

# Hadronization ( or Fragmentation )

Hadronization is the physical process by which quarks and gluons turn into hadrons. 
If one of the quarks in a given hadron is pulled away from its neighbors, the color-force field "stretches" between that quark and its neighbors. In so doing, more and more energy is added to the color-force field as the quarks are pulled apart. At some point, it is energetically cheaper for the color-force field to "snap" into a new quark-antiquark pair. In so doing, energy is conserved because the energy of the color-force field is converted into the mass of the new quarks, and the color-force field can "relax" back to an unstretched state.

Free quarks are never observed, i.e. a quark never exists on its own for a time longer
than ∼ 1/Λ: up, down, strange, charm, and bottom quarks all hadronize, i.e. become part
of a meson or baryon, on a timescale ∼ 1/Λ; the top quark instead decays before it has
time to hadronize.


## Hadron

In particle physics, a hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force (in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force). In contradiction to [leptons], hadrons interact with each other by [[strong force]] [[bosons]]. The name hadron came from the Greek word αδρός ( hadros ) which means strong.

## Lepton 

Lepton is a [[Fermion]]. It means that it has a [[spin]] of 1/2. Leptons are an independent category of particles that do not participate in [[strong force]] interactions due to their lack of color charge (zero color charge). They are not components in other particles and they are not consisted of other particles themselves. They divide into three categories. The [[electron]], the [[mion]] and the lepton [[tau]].

1. A nucleonic particle of a proton.
2. A carrier particle of the electron.
3. > A lepton.


## Tau

## Parton
 
The name Parton was introduced in 1969 from [[Richard Feynman]] to analyze high-energy [[hadron]] collisions. Later it was recognized that Partons described the same objects more commonly known as [[quarks]] and [[gluons]].
### What does the name Parton describe?
1. The number of protons inside the nucleus.
2. Muons, after strong force interaction.
3. > Quarks and gluons.

##Fermion

All the [[fundamental particles]] are either fermions or [[bosons]]. Fermions have half-integer spin and therefore they are constrained by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. They include [[electrons]], [[protons]], [[neutrons]] and consequently [[quarks]] and [[leptons]]. This means that a fermion can be an [[elementary particle]] or a [[composite]] one. 
### How is a fermion dually categorized?

2. Fermions have integer spin.
3. >Fermions have half-integer spin.

### Does the category of fermions include electrons?
1. No, because a fermionic particle is the one that consists of quarks.
2. >Yes. Fermions include electrons, as well as protons and neutrons.
3. No. An electron can never be a fermion, because it has always an integer spin.

## Strong Force

Strong Force is the mechanism that keeps [[nucleus]] particles bound together. It confines [[quarks]] together in order to form [[hadrons]] such as [[protons]] or [[neutrons]], ensuring stability in ordinary matter. Strong Force has [[carrier particles]] called [[gluons]], which mediate the forces between quarks. We should note that quarks forming protons and neutrons are considered to be [[color charged]] particles and they are held together by the [[color force]]. So the strong force between the nucleus may be a residual color force.

1. The force that shows how the electrons interact with each other.
2. The force that applies when there is a strong collision between atoms.
3. > The mechanism that keeps nucleus particles bound together.

1. >Gluons
2. Partons
3. Electrons

2. It gives them a bigger spin.
3. It boosts their kinetic energy in order to leave the nucleus.



## Coupling Constant

A coupling constant is a parameter that measures the strength of the force exerted in an interaction. It is dimensionless and determines values for the four fundamental forces: Strong (As) , Electromagnetic (A), Weak (Aw), Gravity (Ag).
### What is a Coupling Constant?
1. >A parameter that measures the strength of the force exerted in an interaction.
2. A parameter that shows how many couples of quarks are formed in every hadronisation.
3. A parameter that shows in what rate a coupling force appears during a strong interaction. 

### How many dimensions does a Coupling Constant have?
1. Three, as many as the physical world has.
2. >None. Coupling Constant is dimensionless.
3. Two. It refers to events that happen in time and space.

### What fundamental forces does a Coupling Constant determine?
1. None. A Coupling Constant has nothing to do with fundamental forces.
2. >All of them. Strong, Electromagnetic, Weak and Gravity.
3. Only Strong, because in that case we can only have coupling of the quarks.

## As Strong Coupling Constant

Strong Coupling Constant Alpha S (As) is a parameter that measures the strength of the [[strong force]] interactions. It is found that it decreases as the distance between the [[quarks]] decreases and increases as the distance between the quarks increases.

## Neutrinos 

Neutrinos are leptons without an [[electrical charge]] and they have no mass. They almost never interact with the rest of matter. There are three known types of neutrinos that include a charged [[lepton]] and its corresponding neutrino. In other words every charged lepton e- μ- τ- is accompanied  in weak reactions by its own neutrino νe, νμ, ντ. Neutrinos are produced in a variety of interactions, especially in particle decays. In fact, it was through a careful study of radioactive decays that physicists hypothesized the neutrino's existence.

## Quark

Quarks are fundamental structural elements of matter. They are found inside the particles of the [[nucleus]], that is of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]. Protons and neutrons are composed of two types of quarks. Up quarks and down quarks. However nature designed for each type of quark two similar replicas that are heavier than the original, up and down quarks. The heavier replicas of an up quark are called charm and top and the heavier replicas of a down quark are called strange and bottom.

## Richard Feynman

## Electric Charge

## Quantum Chromo Dynamics

Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) is the current local gauge theory used to describe how quarks have strong interactions.

## Color Charge 

There are two types of [[hadrons]]: baryons and mesons. Every [[baryon]] is made up of three quarks and every meson is made of a [[quark]] and an antiquark. For example the [[proton]] is composed of two up quarks and a down quark (uud). All quarks have the same quantum numbers for such properties as [spin], size, parity, etc. Therefore , according to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] which states that no two identical objects can occupy the same place, it is impossible for one particle to contain two of the same kind of quark. Yet the proton contains two up quarks. Because of this contradiction, it was proposed that quarks must have another property with six manifestations. This new property was labeled color (which  should not be confused with the common understanding of color). The six manifestations are termed red, blue, green, antired, antiblue and antigreen. The anti-colors belong appropriately, to the antiquarks. To obey the Exclusion Principle, all three quarks in a [[baryon]] are of different colors and a [[meson]] must contain a colored quark and a quark of the corresponding anticolor.

(This definition is from Lena Hansen from http://www.phy.duke.edu/~kolena/modern/hansen.html)

### What is a color charge?
1.>A property of quarks that was manifested because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
2. The color that an atom has when it is electrically charged.
3. The color of the particle that is in charge in the nucleus strong force interactions.

### Is color charge relevant to the common use of color in everyday life?
1. Yes. just as all the objects that are colored, quarks have various colors depending on their charge.
2. > No. We must not confuse color charge with the concept of color in every day life.
3. It depends on the paint. If it is conductive then this means that the quarks inside it are charged.

### Are all color charged quarks found in a baryon the same color ?
1. Yes. So that they can interact with other baryons of the same color.
2. No. There are two quarks of the same color and one neutral so that it brings chromatic balance.
3. >No. In order to obey the Exclusion Principle all three quarks in a baryon are of different colors.



## Color Force 

Color Force is the strong interaction that is completely based on color charge. When two quarks are close to one another, they exchange [[gluons]] and create a very strong color force field that binds the [[quarks]] together. Because gluons are considered to carry both a color and an anticolor charge, quarks constantly change their color charges as they exchange gluons with other quarks.
A property of color force is that it does not drop off with distance. So during the exchange of gluons between quarks, and when two quarks stretch the color force that binds them together to a bigger space, the color force remains so strong, that a new pair of quark-antiquark is produced before the two quarks are separated. 
Another property of color force is that it appears to exert little force at short distances so that the quarks are like free particles within the confining boundary of the color force and only experience the strong confining force when they begin to get too far apart. 
### Color Force is....
1. The force that affects our brain cells when we come in contact with a color charged object.
2. The force that colors quarks inside a proton.
3. > Color force is the strong interaction that is completely based on color charge. It basically bind the quarks together.

### What is the relation between color force and distance?
1. None. Color force has nothing to do with distance.
2. >Color force does not drop off with distance. The bigger the distance the bigger the color force.
3. Color force is inverse to the distance. The bigger the distance, the smaller the color force. 


## Color Confinement

Color-charged particles cannot be found individually. For this reason, the color-charged quarks are confined in groups ([[hadrons]]) with other quarks. These composites are color neutral (white). Because quarks, (according to the Standard Model's theory of strong interactions) combine only into baryons and mesons, consisting of three quarks and a pair of [[quark]] - antiquark respectively, we conclude that in order to exist in a stable state they must have in total a neutral color charge (zero color charge).


## Carrier Particles ( ατελές )

In particle physics carrier particles, or force carriers, are particles that give rise to forces between other particles. These particles are bubbles of energy ([quanta]) of particular kind of field. 

## Nucleus

## Nucleon

The word nucleon is a general term of the particles that make up the atomic [[nucleus]]. Each atomic nucleus consists of one or more nucleons. There are two kinds of nucleons. The positively charged [[proton]] and the uncharged [neutron].

## Quanta

## Jets

Jets are groups of particles that are produced from specific high energy collisions. Such collisions produce highly energetic [[quarks]] and [[gluons]]. As they move further from the collision point they emit in their turn more gluons, and the last emitted gluons send out even more gluons and so on. This process leads to a cone like shape of particles that is called a jet. In the last phase of a jet, quarks and gluons combine into hadrons, like [[protons]], [[pions]] and [[kaons]].

## Asymptotic Freedom
Due to the fact that the strong force increases with distance, confinement of quarks exists. There are no free quarks; no quarks have the ability to break away from their hadron. However, within a very small area, quarks have the freedom to move anywhere. This property is called asymptotic freedom.
